# RFID logger
## Description
Our main goal is to make system which could help us with stocktaking. We're going to do it using RFID 13.56MHz tags, and device to read it. Device will be connected with our database and app. We consider sharing our system with student research groups at our university. It will be very helpful for them because of possibility of renting tools and devices without many documents.

## Used devices
We're going to build main device on raspberry pi 4. It gives us a lot of computing power and direct connection to AGH's network with cable. We consider to use PN532 RFID module to make our project cheaper and more flexible.

## Instalation of our system
 > Here will be all setup of drivers etc. on OS.
